# CACER Simulator

This repository contains a simulation tool for assessing the **economic**, **financial**, and **energy** performance of renewable energy sharing configurations such as CACER (Configurations for Renewable Energy Sharing in Collective Self-Consumption).

## Description

The simulator supports the evaluation of different collective self-consumption scenarios, including Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) and Groups of Remote Self-Consumers. It provides detailed metrics such as:

- **Economic benefits**: savings and revenues from self-consumed and exported energy.
- **Financial indicators**: Payback Period, Net Present Value (NPV), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
- **Energy performance**: self-consumption levels, self-sufficiency, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions reduction.

## Main Functionalities

`üö® **PAY ATTENTION**: ALL THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONALITIES ARE ALREADY DEVELOPED IN THIS REPOSITORY AND HOW IT WORKS WILL BE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL LATER IN THIS SECTION `

### 1. Photovoltaic Productivity Simulator

A simulator for the photovoltaic productivity has been created. The pvlib open source library is used in way to simulate the producitivity (more information about the library can be found at the following link ...). The main input of the simulators are:

- **location**;
- **capacity of the photovoltaic generator**;
- **yearly derating factor**.

A typical metheorological year (tmy) is extracted from PVGIS datasets. Actually is setted the Europe/Rome timezone as DatetimeIndex for the data. Furthermore, the following photovoltaic module and inverted are chosen to simulate the basic photovoltaic generator (1 kWp generator):

- **module**: 'Shell_Solar_SM100_24__2003__E__';
- **inverter**: 'Enphase_Energy_Inc___M175_24_208_Sxx__208V_'.

The possibility of setting different types of modules and inverters will be developed later. Actually, only fixed mount system are modeled.

The first step of the simulator creates a productiviy profile for 1 kWp generator. After, the productivity profile is scaled with the capacity of the generators and derated over the years with a typical derating factor (this parameter can be changed in the config.yml file).

The flow chart of the photovoltaic producitivity simulatore is showed in the following figure.

  <img title="Photovoltaic_profile_generator_scheme" src="assets\readme_images\Photovoltaic_profile_generator_scheme.png" alt="Photovoltaic_profile_generator_scheme" data-align="center" width="1000">
</div>

A notebook file to run separately a simulation for a photovoltaic generator was developed:

- `main - photovoltaic_productivity_simulator.ipynb`.

In this notebook we need to specify:

- **location**;
- **number of years of the simulation**;
- **capacity**;
- **tilt angle**;
- **azimuth angle**;
- **derating factor**;
- **directory to save the csv file with results**.

üö® **PAY ATTENTION**: In the CACER simulation (using the `main - CACER.ipynb` file) the inputs for the simulation of the productivity are setted in a different way (using `user CACER.xlsx` file).

### 2. BESS Simulator

### 3. Load Profile Domestic Users Emulator

A domestic load profile emulator has been created that uses the load profiles of individual household appliances and their quarterly usage probabilities. The household appliances considered are:
- fridge;
- washing-machine;
- dish-washer;
- oven;
- microwaves;
- tv.

Additionally, a base load has been added in order to have a realistic aggregate load profile. Based on the probability of switching on of individual appliances, an activation instant is extracted at a probabilistic level. The appliance consumption profile is then scheduled and added to the aggregate daily profile. The same procedure is used for each individual appliance, for each day and for each emulated user. An explanatory flow chart is reported below.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img title="Flow_chart_load_emulator" src="assets\readme_images\Flow_chart_load_emulator.png" alt="Flow_chart_load_emulator" data-align="center" width="1000">
</div>

With this methodology, aggregate load profiles for domestic users are obtained similar to those shown in the following explanatory figure.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img title="Load_emulator_result_example" src="assets\readme_images\Load_emulator_result_example.png" alt="Load_emulator_result_example" data-align="center" width="600">
</div>

In order to add greater randomness to the generation of load profiles, the following functions have been introduced that can be activated through appropriate flags:
- **Multiple daily activation of the appliance**, it is expected that the appliance can be activated up to a maximum of three times per day. The number of activations is determined at a probabilistic level.
- **Probability of activation of the appliance on the day in question**, in this case not all appliances are activated daily. The activation is determined at a probabilistic level.

More features will be implemented soon. For example:
- A large dataset with the load profile of the appliance to consider different technology levels.
- The profiles of the appliances will be selected based on the socio-territorial context in which the domestic users are being emulated.
- etc.

More information about using the emulator can be found in the file:

- `main - load_profile_emulator.ipynb`.
