# CACER Simulator

This repository contains a simulation tool for assessing the **economic**, **financial**, and **energy** performance of renewable energy sharing configurations such as CACER (Configurations for Renewable Energy Sharing in Collective Self-Consumption).

## Description

The simulator supports the evaluation of different collective self-consumption scenarios, including Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) and Groups of Remote Self-Consumers. It provides detailed metrics such as:

- **Economic benefits**: savings and revenues from self-consumed and exported energy.
- **Financial indicators**: Payback Period, Net Present Value (NPV), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
- **Energy performance**: self-consumption levels, self-sufficiency, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions reduction.

## Repository Structure

- `assets/`: contains visual outputs or auxiliary resources.
- `files/`: input/output files and configuration data for simulations.
- `Functions_Load_Emulator_and_DSM.py`: functions for emulating the residential load profile and for simulating demand-side flexibility and management.
- `Functions_Energy_Model.py`: core energy modeling functions for CACER simulations (photovoltaic productivity simulation, load profile extraction, etc.).
- `Functions_Financial_Model.py`: functions for financial analysis and investment evaluation (Discounted Cash Flow analysis).
- `Functions_General.py`: general-purpose utility functions used throughout the project.
- `config.yml`: configuration file with key parameters for the simulations and path of file and forlders.
- `main - CACER tutorial.ipynb`: interactive Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step instructions for using the CACER simulator.
- `main - CACER.ipynb`: interactive Jupyter Notebook for using the CACER simulator (cleaned version, without tutorial).
- `main - load_profile_emulator.ipynb`: interactive Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step instructions for emulating domestic load profile.
- `Reporting.ipynb`: notebook to generate performance reports.
- `users CACER.xlsx`: example Excel file with user data.

### 3. Load Profile Domestic Users Emulator

A domestic load profile emulator has been created that uses the load profiles of individual household appliances and their quarterly usage probabilities. The household appliances considered are:
- fridge;
- washing-machine;
- dish-washer;
- oven;
- microwaves;
- tv.
Additionally, a base load has been added in order to have a realistic aggregate load profile......
